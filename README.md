  <b>Anemoia-ESP32</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Anemoia-ESP32 is a rewrite and port of the Anemoia Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator running directly on the ESP32.  
  It is written in C++ and is designed to bring classic NES games to the ESP32.  
  This project focuses on performance, being able to run the emulator at native speeds and with full audio emulation implemented. However, games with complex mappers may induce a small speed loss.

## Performance
Anemoia-ESP32 is heavily optimized to achieve native NES speeds on the ESP32, running at ~60.098 FPS (NTSC) with full audio emulation enabled.

Here are the performance benchmarks for several popular NES games. 
> [!NOTE]
> The following benchmarks show average framerates recorded over 8192 frames (~2 minutes) of emulation time. Some games, such as `Kirby's Adventure`, which frequently switch banks may experience significant FPS drops in certain sections.

| Game                    | Mapper    | Average FPS   |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Super Mario Bros.**   | NROM (0)  | **60.10 FPS** |
| **Contra**              | UxROM (2) | **60.10 FPS** |
| **The Legend of Zelda** | MMC1 (1)  | **60.10 FPS** |
| **Mega Man 2**          | MMC1 (1)  | **60.10 FPS** |
| **Castlevania**         | UxROM (2) | **60.10 FPS** |
| **Metroid**             | MMC1 (1)  | **60.10 FPS** |
| **Kirby’s Adventure**   | MMC3 (4)  | **59.57 FPS** |
| **Donkey Kong**         | NROM (0)  | **60.10 FPS** |


## Compatibility

As of now, Anemoia-ESP32 has implemented five major memory mappers, totalling to around 79% of the entire NES game catalogue. 
Feel free to open an issue if a game has glitches or fails to boot.

## Getting Started

1. Upload the `Anemoia-ESP32.ino` program into the ESP32
2. Put .nes game roms inside the root of a microSD card
3. Insert the microSD card into the microSD card module
4. Power on the ESP32 and select a game from the file select menu

## How to build and upload

### Step 1

Either use `git clone https://github.com/Shim06/Anemoia-ESP32.git` on the command line to clone the repository or use Code → Download zip button and extract to get the files.

### Step 2
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE. 
2. In <b> File → Preferences → Additional boards manager URLs </b> , add:
```cmd
https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
```
3. Download the ESP32 board support `v3.2.1` through <b> Tools → Board → Boards Manager </b>. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to download version 3.2.1, as different board versions may have worse performance.
4. Download the `SdFat` and `TFT_eSPI` libraries from <b> Tools → Manage Libraries </b>.

### Step 3 - Configure TFT_eSPI
The emulator uses a custom display configuration for the ST7789 display.
1. Navigate to your Arduino Libraries folder:
(Default location): `Documents/Arduino/libraries/TFT_eSPI`
2. Open `User_Setup_Select.h` in a text editor.
3. Comment out `#include <User_Setup.h>` and any other setup includes and add `<User_Setups/Anemoia-ST7789.h>`:
```C++
// #include <User_Setup.h>
#include <User_Setups/Anemoia-ST7789.h>
```
4. Copy the provided `Anemoia-ST7789.h` file from this repository into
`TFT_eSPI/User_Setups/`. Optionally, edit the `#define` pins as desired.
> [!NOTE]
> If using a screen with the ILI9341 driver, open `Anemoia-ST7789.h` in a text editor and comment out `#define ST7789_DRIVER` and uncomment `#define ILI9341_DRIVER`.
> ```C++
> // #define ST7789_DRIVER
> #define ILI9341_DRIVER
> ```

### Step 4 - Apply custom build flags
1. Locate your ESP32 Arduino platform directory. This is typically at:
```cmd
\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\{version}\
```
2. Copy the `platform.txt` file from this repository and paste into that folder.
This file defines additional compiler flags and optimizations used by Anemoia-ESP32.
> [!WARNING]
> Backup your `platform.txt` file if you have your own custom settings already. 

### Step 5 - Upload
1. Connect your ESP32 via USB.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to <b> Tools → Board </b> and select your ESP32 board (e.g., ESP32 Dev Module).
3. Click Upload or press `Ctrl+U` to build and flash the emulator. Optionally, edit the `#define` pins as desired.
